A paper by [Johnson and Bif (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-021-00807-z) demonstrated that diel cycles of oxygen can be observed using the Argo network as a collective set of sensors. Previously, [Gilles (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2012JC007883) demonstrated a the same for diel cycles of temperature. The calculation of the diel cycle depends on multiple factors, one of them being that floats included in the analysis do not surface at the fixed or few local times of day for every profile. Instead, floats must demonstrate good temporal coverage a 24hr period with near even occurrences.

![Figure 2 from [Johnson and Bif (2021).](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-021-00807-z) Their caption reads: *a*, Mean oxygen anomaly in the upper 20 m from each profile with acceptable cycle timing (N = 14,294) versus local hour of the day. Data from all days of year from 2010 to 2020 are included. *b*, Mean oxygen anomaly in each hourly interval and the least-squares fit of equation (2) to the data shown in a with GOP = 2.2 $\pm$ 0.3 (1 standard error) mmol m$^{−3}$ d$^{−1}$ O2. *c*, GOP determined at 2-month intervals in the upper 20 m versus day of year. *d*, Depth profile of GOP rates for all days of the year. Error bars are one standard error.](Johnson_Bif_figure_2.png)

This is not necessarily typical behaviour for Argo floats. For the analysis presented in [Johnson and Bif (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-021-00807-z), of the 50,736 profiles available in the Northern Hemisphere, only 14,294 profiles satisfied the surface time requirements. In this post we will detail Argo Canada's effort over the last 2-3 years to shift it's Argo floats to satisfy this surfacing schedule and contribute to future research using this methodology.

The post will be a mix of text and python code, showing both the changes over time and the python code needed to demonstrate the change. We will use `pandas` for data handling, and `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for plotting. Lets load our packages and the Argo global index:

```{python py setup and load index, echo=TRUE, results=FALSE}
import pandas as pd

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
sns.set(style="ticks", palette="colorblind")

# load the global index
global_index = pd.read_csv(
  "ftp://ftp.ifremer.fr/ifremer/argo/ar_index_global_prof.txt.gz", 
  compression="gzip", header=8
)
# subset to only the MEDS DAC, profiles with valid dates
meds = global_index.loc[global_index.file.str.contains('meds')]
meds = meds.loc[meds.date.notna()]

# convert date to pandas timestamps, take only profiles from the last 3 years
meds["date"] = meds.date.astype(str).apply(lambda x: x.replace(".0", "")).apply(pd.Timestamp, tz="utc")
meds = meds.loc[meds.date > pd.Timestamp("01-2020", tz="utc")]
```

Now that we have loaded all the MEDS profiles from 2020 onward, we have some final subsets to make. MetOcean NOVA floats are still operating for Argo Canada. Because these floats neither have the capacity to define surfacing times, nor update parameters remotely, we will exclude them. The few surviving Teledyne-Webb APEX floats will also be excluded. Finally, recently deployed deep ARVOR floats will be excluded, as their cycle period is defined as an integer number of days rather than in hours. From there, we will calculate the local time using the location data, and python packages `timezonefinder` and `pytz`, and visualize local surfacing times over the last 3 years.

```{python local times, echo=TRUE, results=FALSE}
import timezonefinder
tf = timezonefinder.TimezoneFinder()
import pytz

# remove NOVA floats, only use NKE floats
profiler_type = {
    "836":"PROVOR   ",
    "844":"ARVOR_SBE",
    "878":"ARVOR_RBR",
}
meds = meds.loc[meds.profiler_type.isin([int(p) for p in profiler_type.keys()])]

# exclude invalid locations
meds = meds.loc[(meds.latitude.notna()) & (meds.longitude.notna())]

# get timezone, local time, and hour at surface for each profile
meds["timezone"] = [pytz.timezone(tf.certain_timezone_at(lat=lat, lng=lon)) for lat, lon in zip(meds.latitude, meds.longitude)]
meds["local_time"] = [utc_time.tz_convert(tz) for utc_time, tz in zip(meds.date, meds.timezone)]
meds["surface_hour"] = [local_time.hour + 0.5 for local_time in meds.local_time]

# add a column for WMO number as well as platform name
meds["WMO"] = [int(s.split("/")[1]) for s in meds.file]
meds["platform"] = [profiler_type[f"{p}"] for p in meds.profiler_type]

fig, ax = plt.subplots(dpi=300, constrained_layout=True)
sns.lineplot(data=meds, x="local_time", y="surface_hour", style="WMO", 
  dashes=False, legend=False, alpha=0.5, markers=True, ax=ax
)
```

The above plot is very busy, but clearly shows a shift in regime in mid-2021 when we began reprogramming all new deployments as well as existing floats via remote commands. For NKE ARVOR floats, which constitute most of the Canadian fleet, we set the cycle period to 245 hours, or 10 days + 5 hours. This creates diel coverage relatively quickly, without sampling at times near each other on subsequent profiles. NKE PROVOR floats were slightly trickier to reprogram, as instead of a cycle period they have a surface time they aim to achieve. This parameter therefore must be reprogrammed every cycle. This is achieved by running a daily github action powered by python, which you can find on the [ArgoCanada github page](https://github.com/ArgoCanada/provor-auto-param-update). 

To better understand the timing, lets look closely at an ARVOR float that was reprogrammed, and a PROVOR float that gets a new command each cycle. 

```{python individual floats, echo=TRUE, results=FALSE, fig.show="hide"}
# ARVOR deployed in 2021, PROVOR in 2022
arvor  = 4902523
provor = 4902623
subset = meds.loc[meds.WMO.isin((arvor, provor))]
# make day of mission our time variable so we can plot them on the same axis
subset["mission_day"] = [
  subset.date.loc[i] - subset.date.loc[subset.WMO == subset.WMO.loc[i]].min()\
  for i in subset.index
]
# fractional days
subset["mission_day"] = subset["mission_day"].apply(lambda x: x/pd.to_timedelta(1, 'D'))

fig, ax = plt.subplots(dpi=300, constrained_layout=True)
sns.lineplot(data=subset, x="mission_day", y="surface_hour", hue="platform", 
  style="platform", dashes=False, markers=True, ax=ax
)
ax.set_xlim((0,300))
```
```{python fig 2, echo=FALSE}
plt.show(fig)
```

The ARVOR float was deployed in 2020, and was reprogrammed remotely in the second half of 2021. The PROVOR float was deployed before the surface time reprogramming protocol was live, but has begun taking commands as of May 2023. The lines slope in opposite directions because the ARVORs operate on a 10 days + 5 hours (245hr) cycle, while the PROVORs are being programmed for 10 days - 5 hours (235hr) cycle. The latter is a minor difference, but was a suggestion from the manufacturer as it may produce an extra profile or two if/when a float dies of exhausted battery life. 

Finally, to get a better idea of how we have performed fleet-wide, let's look at the distributions of surfacing times since 2020 by year. 

```{python surface time distributions, echo=TRUE, results=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.show="hide"}
# create column for profile year
meds["year"] = [d.year for d in meds.local_time]
# create a FacetGrid that will plot by year, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023
g = sns.displot(
  meds, x="surface_hour", col="year", hue="platform", 
  kind="hist", bins=list(range(24)), multiple="stack", 
  col_wrap=2, facet_kws=dict(despine=False, sharey=False)
)
g.fig.set_dpi(300)
g.fig.set_constrained_layout(True)
```
```{python fig 3, echo=FALSE}
plt.show(g.fig)
```

The above figure shows the progression of the Canadian Argo fleet over the years. Blue bars correspond to ARVOR floats with Seabird CTDs, orange bars to ARVOR floats with RBR CTDs and green bars to PROVOR floats. In the 2020 panel, there are two peaks, one representing local times in the Eastern Pacific, and the other in the Western Atlantic. In 2021 these peaks persist, but for roughly half the year we have good coverage. In 2022, some peaks remain as the final floats still operating on 240 hour cycles are reprogrammed. In the final panel, we see that the fleet operates well to cover the entire day. There are slight biases toward 0600-0700 and 1400-1500 local times in the PROVOR floats (green bars) as the live reprogramming was not active until May this year, but those profiles are now being well distributed. Overall, almost all recent profiles recorded by Argo Canada floats should now meet the statistical criteria to be able to construct diel cycles as in [Gilles (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2012JC007883) and [Johnson and Bif (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-021-00807-z).
