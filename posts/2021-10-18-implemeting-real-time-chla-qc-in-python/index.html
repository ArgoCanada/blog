<div class="d-article">
<p>This post is a rough guide to implementing real-time adjustments to CHLA values in Argo NetCDF files. The real-time adjustments are relatively new and reflect a balance between simplicity and completeness, with the understanding that delayed-mode QC will be more robust and incorporate more float-specific considerations. In case it’s not clear, nothing in this post should be construed as a definitive QC implementation and should be subject to considerable testing prior to deployment as actual live QC.</p>
<p>To implement the tests on existing ArgoNetCDF files in Python, we’ll use the <a href="https://github.com/ArgoCanada/argopandas">argopandas</a> package (to list float profiles and do some basic interaction with Argo NetCDF files) and <a href="https://teos-10.github.io/GSW-Python/">gsw</a> (to perform seawater calculations required for some of the checks). We’ll also use <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a> data frames and <a href="https://numpy.org/">numpy</a> arrays to marshal the generic data handling and <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> to plot as we go along.</p>

<h3 id="example-data">Example data</h3>
<p>We’ll need some data to practice with, too. As an example, I’ll use all the profiles from float 6904117. It’s probably best to use a fresh cache for every Python session (the default), but for the purposes of rendering this post I’ll use a local cache to avoid downloading the files everytime I render it.</p>

<h3 id="the-recipe">The recipe</h3>
<p>As I understand it, this is what has to happen to the real-time measurements during the CHLA processing:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CHLA</code> values whose flags are unset are flagged as <code>Flag.PROBABLY_BAD</code></li>
<li><code>CHLA_ADJUSTED</code> values whose flags are unset are flagged as <code>Flag.GOOD</code></li>
<li>Apply global range test (flag for <code>CHLA</code> and <code>CHLA_ADJUSTED</code> set to <code>Flag.BAD</code> for CHLA values outside the range -0.1 to 100)</li>
<li>Apply the “dark correction” to <code>CHLA</code> values:
<ul>
<li>Read the <code>SCIENTIFIC_CALIB_COEFFICIENT</code> variable for the CHLA profile and parse the <code>FLOAT_DARK</code>, and <code>FLOAT_DARK_QC</code> values. It is likely that <code>FLOAT_DARK_QC</code> doesn’t exist in any files yet, so default to <code>Flag.NO_QC</code>. For profiles that haven’t gone through 5 cycles deeper than the “mixed layer depth”, there should be a <code>PRELIM_DARK</code> variable in <code>SCIENTIFIC_CALIB_COEFFICIENT</code></li>
<li>If <code>FLOAT_DARK</code> exists, apply the equation <code>CHLA_ADJUSTED = ((FLUORESCENCE_CHLA-FLOAT_DARK)*SCALE_CHLA)/2</code>.</li>
<li>If it doesn’t, calculate try to calculate <code>PRELIM_DARK</code> and look for 4 previous instances of <code>PRELIM_DARK</code> with which <code>FLOAT_DARK/_QC</code> should be calculated. If there are 5 <code>PRELIM_DARK</code> values, calculate <code>FLOAT_DARK/_QC</code> and use that. If there aren’t calculate the adjusted value using <code>PRELIM_DARK</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Apply the non-photochemical quenching correction (NPC) to the value calculated by the dark correction. This is the correction for the upper portion of the ocean whereby phytoplankton have a reduced response to UV light because they have already been exposed to it from the sun.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few of these steps have details that need to be expanded upon, so let’s do those first</p>
<h3 id="qc-flags">QC Flags</h3>
<p>In addition to computing adjusted realtime values, the QC checks for CHLA also flag some values using the Argo flag scheme. One of the challeneges in doing this is that you don’t want to make a data point look “better” by assigning a QC flag (e.g., flag a value as “probably bad” when it’s already been flagged as “bad”). This logic was implemented by the experimental <a href="https://github.com/euroargodev/argortqcpy">argortqcpy</a> package (<a href="https://github.com/euroargodev/argortqcpy/blame/main/argortqcpy/checks.py">here</a>) and I’ve modified it slightly to get all of the flag logic in one happy Python class:</p>

<p>As I understand it, there are as many ways to calculate the mixed layer depth as there are oceanographers. The following is an implementation based on the guidance provided in the draft CHLA QC document. I’m using <code>plt</code> as an argument here so that you can debug this stuff interactively (but skip installing matplotlib in production). The gist is that it looks for density changes &gt; 0.03 below 10 dbar.</p>

<h3 id="calculating-float_dark">Calculating FLOAT_DARK</h3>
<p>The guidance on calculating <code>PRELIM_DARK</code> is that it’s the minimum <code>CHLA</code> value below the mixed layer depth boundary. In Python:</p>

<p>Calculating <code>FLOAT_DARK</code> is a little more involved and it’s where we’ll make use of our float/cycle index that we created earlier. We need to start from the first NetCDF file for the float and collect any <code>PRELIM_DARK</code> values from <code>SCIENTIFIC_CALIB_COEFFICIENT</code> that might have been calculated. If there were 3 or fewer, we do nothing. If there are exactly 4, we add our <code>PRELIM_DARK</code> that we just calculated, calculate the mean of the values, and use that. The <code>FLOAT_DARK_QC</code> gets added based on the standard deviation of the <code>PRELIM_DARK</code> values.</p>

<p>The rest is not very oceanographic but does involve navigating the structure of BGC variables’ encoding in Argo profile NetCDFs. First, we get a <code>NetCDFWrapper</code> handle and a local filename to the .nc file. In argopandas, a <code>NetCDFWrapper</code> is a thin wrapper around a <code>netCDF4.Dataset</code> that implements a few common accessors in addition to the most common accessors for the dataset (notably, <code>obj.variables</code> and <code>obj['variable name']</code>).</p>

<p>The first step is to set the initial QC values to <code>Flag.PROBABLY_BAD</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb20"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb20-1"><a href="#cb20-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>chla_qc[:] <span class="op">=</span> Flag.PROBABLY_BAD</span>

<p>Then we apply the global range test:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb21"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb21-1"><a href="#cb21-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Flag.update_safely(chla_qc, Flag.BAD, where<span class="op">=</span>(chla <span class="op">&lt;</span> <span class="fl">0.1</span>) <span class="op">|</span> (chla <span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="dv">100</span>))</span>

<p>Next, we go through the steps for the dark correction. This profile was collected before any of this QC was implemented so it doesn’t contain any <code>PRELIM_DARK</code> or <code>FLOAT_DARK</code>. I’ll write out the logic anyway.</p>

<p>There are no previous <code>PRELIM_DARK</code> values and no <code>FLOAT_DARK</code> value, so this applies the calculation based on the current profile.</p>
<p>From my reading of the document, that’s the operation! What’s left is to figure out what changed and modify the NetCDF. There is probably an object diff library in Python that could do a good job of reporting what changed and I’d encourage readers to implement it! The objects that might have changed are <code>coefs_mod</code> (check differences with <code>coefs</code>) and <code>chla_qc</code> (check differences via <code>chla_qc_original</code>). <code>chla_adjusted</code> and <code>chla_adjusted_qc</code> can be written without checking diffs since in theory a brand new file won’t have those variables anyway.</p>
<p>I imagine modification would be done by making a copy of the NetCDF file and opening via <code>netCDF4.Dataset()</code> in write mode.</p>
